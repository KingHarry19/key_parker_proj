This is a simple web app hosted with the express.js server on Port 8080.

In the command line or bash prompt, when the app is launched it will begin the connection to the server.

To launch the server: Open a command prompt.
> cd .../key

The command line will print out the current date time in YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss format every 30 seconds.

The web app will have 3 input fields. Title, Name, Email address.
These values are all required.
When these values are submitted, an alert will popup informing the user that their details have been submitted and will print out 
the information the user has provided.

There is a reset button which can be used to clear the form at any time.
